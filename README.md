# peerPlus

Before a doctor’s visit, the AI asks the patient a few questions about their symptoms and health. It then summarizes the answers and combines them with the patient’s medical history, giving the doctor a clear overview before the appointment. PEER+, or Pre-Exam Evaluation Resource, will help determine a disease, as well as potential treatment plans with ease, especially in minority communities with less access to healthcare. PEER+ comes in Spanish and English.
